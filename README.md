# SimScale-Grasshopper plugin
The use case this plugin is currenty developed for is to visulise SimScale results for wind speed within the Rhino environment using grasshopper. This use case includes also doing additional post processing to the results using Ladybug tools to produce outdoor thermal comfort parameters. We include a some examples of how this can be done, but its by no means an extensive overview of what can be done, and some expertise using Ladybug tools is recomended to perform the outdoor comfort calulations.

SimScale developed this plugin to help our users in the AEC industry to get more out of the results, and we see this plugin as a community contribution, where the coomunity is equally welcomed to maintain and improve it.

# Examples
1. basic.gh - A very basic visulisation of wind speed, given a reference speed and direction
1. basic_humantosky_example.gh - This is the example of outdoor thermal comfort most easy to comprehend, with little complexities surrounding it. It is however rather slow to compute and we consider this a stepping stone in one ones learning journey
1. basic_radiance_example - Not yet developed
